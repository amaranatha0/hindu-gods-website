            <h2>Lord Vishnu</h2>
            <img src="images/vishnu.jpg" alt="Lord Vishnu" style="width:200px;height:300px;">
            <p>Lord Vishnu is one of the principal deities in Hinduism, known as the Preserver and Protector within the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti), which also includes Brahma the Creator and Shiva the Destroyer. Vishnu is revered as the supreme deity who maintains cosmic order and dharma (moral law). He is often depicted in a serene and majestic form, with a blue complexion symbolizing his infinite and all-pervading nature. Vishnu holds a conch (shankha), discus (chakra), mace (gada), and lotus (padma) in his four hands, each representing various aspects of existence and the divine power.</p>
            <h3>Avatars of Vishnu</h3>
            <p>A distinctive feature of Vishnu's mythology is his avatars, or incarnations, through which he descends to Earth to restore balance and righteousness. The most famous avatars include Rama, the hero of the Ramayana, and Krishna, a central figure in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu's avatars are numerous, each appearing during times of crisis to combat evil forces and guide humanity. The concept of Dashavatara lists ten principal avatars, starting with the fish Matsya and culminating in Kalki, who is yet to appear.</p>
            <h3>Festivals</h3>
            <p>Devotees of Vishnu, known as Vaishnavas, engage in various forms of worship and devotion, including chanting his names, singing hymns, and participating in festivals. Among the most significant festivals dedicated to Vishnu are Janmashtami, celebrating the birth of Krishna, and Rama Navami, marking the birth of Rama. Additionally, the festival of Diwali, particularly in North India, is associated with the return of Rama to Ayodhya. Vishnu temples, characterized by their grandeur and intricate architecture, are found throughout India and the world, with the Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati.</p>
